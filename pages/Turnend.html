        <p>Your spark will continue to move through the circuit as long as your spark is charged. A spark
            looses it's charge if your spark encounters a dead end, exits an open card, or overloads by
            passing circuit cards already visited.</p>

            <p>A dead end is noted by the cut corners. A spark will loose it's charge when it enters the
